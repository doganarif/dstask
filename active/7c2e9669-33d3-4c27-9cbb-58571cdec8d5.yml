summary: Fix Worker
notes: |+
  Need to check worker and scheduler. its working manual, scheduler not triggering or we couldnt understand what's happening to worker.

  Need to simulate worker stuff.

  step 1: Check cache adding steps for active space.
  step 2: Check cache reader, its worker, worker reads cache and creates jobs for each active space record.
  step 3: Check workers job creation
